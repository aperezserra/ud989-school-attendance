===========================

Files Descriptions:
# NOTE: Any file can be used indistinctly obtaining the same result #
app.js    -> Final MV* oriented code (The objective of this exercise).
app2.js   -> Code migrated from jquery to Vanilla JS using DOM API only.
app3.js   -> Original code.


Steps to accomplish:
1. I don't know jquery so I will try to convert the code to Vanilla JS in order
to understand better what is going on in the code (It would be a good practice).

2. After step one, then the js code will be addressed from an MV* perspective,
which to my understanding seems what is missing in this code.

.......To be continued............

â€¢ Step one was completed successfully, the jquery code was ported to Vanilla JS
using only the DOM API with full functionality and only 6 extra lines. The
function that generates and initial attendance was left untouched because is not
the purpose of this exercise to tinker with it, that's the only reason why jquery
will be left in the html code.
