===========================

1. I don't know jquery so I will try to convert the code to Vanilla JS in order
to understand better what is going on in the code (It would be a good practice).

2. After step one, then the js code will be addressed from an MV* perspective,
which to my understanding seems what is missing in this code.

.......To be continued.
